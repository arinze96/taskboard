i compress the entire code with the vendors and the .env(environmental variables)
i also added the slq database in the root project directory. the name of sql database is taskboard.sql

how the app works

1. the first input is where you add the task name
2. the second input is where you add the project where the task you are creating will be classified
3. the 3rd select tab where "normal" is pre selected as the priority level
4. if you add the task name, select project and select the priority level and click the add task button it will add task
5. the filter select contains the project category of each task and if you select one and press the filter button it will return the tasks classified     under that project
6. if you click the pen icon which is designed to edit the selected task, once clicked a modal will pop up where you can edit the task
7. the bucket icon is used to delete a task, once you click it an alert pops up and if you click ok it will be deleted
